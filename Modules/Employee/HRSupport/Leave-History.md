# Leave History

The **Leave History** module provides a comprehensive log of all leave applications submitted across the organization. It is a centralized tool for tracking, reviewing, and managing employee leave records.

## Key Features

### 1. Organization-Wide Leave Records
Displays a complete list of all leaves applied by employees, including relevant details such as:
- **Leave type**
- **Duration**
- **Date of application**

### 2. Approval Tracking
- Shows the assigned **leave approvers**
- Displays the current **leave status** (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected)

### 3. Attached Documentation
- If a reason or supporting document (e.g., medical certificate) was submitted, it is accessible directly within the record.

### 4. Leave Cancellation
- Employees or HR personnel (based on access rights) can **cancel a leave request**, provided it meets the organization's leave policy conditions.
