# Staff Attendance – INST and DEPT

The **Staff Attendance – INST and DEPT** modules are two submenus designed to display employee attendance data, segmented by **Institute** and **Department** based on the user's access level.

## Key Features

- **Institute-Level Attendance (INST)**  
  Displays attendance records for all employees within the **institute** the user belongs to. Ideal for institute-level administrators and HR personnel.

- **Department-Level Attendance (DEPT)**  
  Shows attendance for employees within the user's **own department**, allowing department heads or managers to track attendance locally.

- **Filterable Grid View**  
  Attendance data is presented in a structured grid format, with filters available for:
  - Month of Attendance
  - School/Institute
  - Department
  - Employee Type (e.g., Staff, Consultant)

These submenus provide a quick and accurate way to monitor employee attendance trends, support payroll processing, and ensure departmental accountability.
