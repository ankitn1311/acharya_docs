# Student Admission Overview

The student admission process at Acharya Institute is designed to be flexible, efficient, and user-friendly, accommodating both direct applicants and walk-in candidates. The system ensures that all necessary information is captured and that each applicant is guided through a structured workflow, from initial registration to final enrollment.

## Ways to Get Admission

There are two primary pathways for student admission:

### 1. Direct Admission

- **Quick Admission:**  
  Applicants can apply directly through the Quick Admission module. This process captures all essential details—personal, academic, address, bank, and program information—in a single, streamlined workflow.
- **Process:**
  1. Applicant submits details via the Quick Admission form.
  2. The student is directly admitted after entering all required details.
  3. The student is officially enrolled and can proceed with further onboarding steps.

### 2. Walk-In Registration

- **Register Walk-In Candidate:**  
  For candidates who visit the campus in person, the front-desk or admissions staff use the Walk-In Candidate Registration module to quickly capture basic information.
- **Process:**
  1. Staff register the walk-in candidate, capturing personal, contact, and academic details.
  2. The candidate's record enters the standard admission workflow.
  3. An offer letter is generated and communicated to the candidate.
  4. The counsellor updates the offer status (accepted/rejected).
  5. If accepted, a payment link is generated for the candidate.
  6. After payment, the candidate completes the full admission form (as in Quick Admission) and is officially enrolled.

## Further Process

Regardless of the entry point (direct or walk-in), all candidates follow a unified process after initial registration:

1. **Offer Letter Generation:**  
   The admissions team reviews the application and issues an offer letter (for walk-in candidates).

2. **Offer Status Update:**  
   The counsellor updates the system with the candidate's response.

3. **Payment Link Generation:**  
   If the offer is accepted, a payment link is generated and shared with the candidate.

4. **Final Admission:**  
   Upon payment confirmation, the candidate completes the full admission form, and the student is officially enrolled.
