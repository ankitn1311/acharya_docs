# No Due Report

The **No Due Report** section in Acharya ERP provides a hierarchical view of all types of student dues, grouped by school, course, and semester. Administrators can drill down from a summary of dues at the school level to detailed lists of students with their respective dues for each semester. This enables efficient tracking and management of outstanding amounts across the institution.
