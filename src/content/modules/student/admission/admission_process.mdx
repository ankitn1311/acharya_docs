# Admission Process

The **Admission Process** module at Acharya Institute orchestrates the complete student onboarding workflow, from initial offer to final admission. This structured process ensures transparency, accountability, and efficiency for both applicants and administrative staff.

---

## Process Overview

The admission process consists of the following key stages:

1. **Offer Letter Generation:**  
   After a candidate applies or walks in, the admissions team reviews the application and generates an official offer letter. This letter outlines the program, school, academic year, admission category, and fee template.

2. **Offer Status Update by Counsellor:**  
   The assigned counsellor communicates the offer to the candidate and updates the system with the candidate's response (Accepted/Rejected). Remarks can be added for additional context.

3. **Payment Link Generation:**  
   Upon acceptance of the offer, the system automatically generates a secure payment link for the candidate. This link enables the candidate to pay the required admission or program fees online.

4. **Final Admission & Data Entry:**  
   Once payment is confirmed, the candidate proceeds to the final admission stage. Here, all required details—including personal, academic, address, bank, and document information—are captured in the system, completing the admission process.
