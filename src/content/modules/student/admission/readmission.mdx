# Re-Admission

The **Re-Admission** module at Acharya Institute manages the process of promoting students to a new semester or academic session. This ensures that student records, fee structures, and academic progress are accurately updated as students advance in their programs.

---

## Overview

Re-admission is required for students progressing to the next semester or session. The process verifies eligibility, updates academic and fee details, and officially promotes the student to the next stage of their academic journey.

---

## Process Flow

1. **Student Search:**  
   The administrator/counsellor searches for the student using a unique identifier (AUID or USN).

2. **Student & Academic Details Review:**  
   The system displays the student's current details, including program, academic batch, admission category, proctor, and contact information.

3. **Select Academic Year & Semester:**  
   The user selects the new academic year and semester/session to which the student is being promoted.

4. **Fee Template & Structure Display:**  
   The applicable fee template, currency, and admission category are shown. The system displays a detailed fee breakdown for the selected semester/session, including tuition, registration, development, and other fees.

5. **Re-Admission Fee Entry:**  
   If applicable, a re-admission fee can be entered.

6. **Confirmation & Promotion:**  
   After verifying all details, the administrator confirms the re-admission. The student is officially promoted to the new semester/session, and records are updated accordingly.
