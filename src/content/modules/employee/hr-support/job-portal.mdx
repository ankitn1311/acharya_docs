## Job Portal
    

The Job Portal module acts as a centralized hub for managing all job applications received through the organization’s website. It streamlines the recruitment lifecycle—from application review to final onboarding.

Key Features and Workflow:

#### 1.  Applicant Management   
    All applications submitted for open roles are listed here. Users with appropriate HR support access can:  
      
    

*   View applicant profiles  
      
    
*   Update the HR status (e.g., Shortlisted, On Hold, Rejected)  
      
    
*   Provide comments and notes for internal tracking  
      
    

#### 2.  Interview Scheduling  
    Once an applicant is Shortlisted, the system enables the option to schedule interviews:  
      
    

*   One or more interviewers can be selected  
      
    
*   Interview timings and additional details can be configured  
      
    
*   Email notifications can be sent to both the candidate and the interviewers  
      
    

#### 3.  Interview Feedback  
    After the interview is conducted:  
      
    

*   Each interviewer submits individual feedback and remarks  
      
    
*   HR can add additional comments and manage the interview evaluation process  
      
    
*   Once all interviews are completed, the cumulative feedback is displayed for final decision-making  
      
    

#### 4.  Offer Management  
    Upon successful completion of the interview process:  
      
    

*   The system displays the candidate's evaluation summary, role-specific salary breakup, and the offer letter template  
      
    
*   HR can proceed to generate a formal job offer by specifying:  
      
    

*   Reporting manager  
      
    
*   Proposed joining date  
      
    
#### 5.  Recruitment and Onboarding
  
    After the job offer is accepted:  
      
    

*   HR can initiate the final recruitment process by clicking the "+" icon under the Recruitment section  
      
    
*   A form appears to capture all necessary employee details (e.g., personal info, department, designation)  
      
    
*   Upon submission, the recruitment is marked complete, and the employee is officially onboarded into the organization
