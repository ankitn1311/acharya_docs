# ðŸŽª Event Booking

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

The Event Booking feature under the My Menu section allows employees to submit booking requests for official or institutional events. These can include events such as graduation ceremonies, festival celebrations, academic gatherings, and other organizational functions.

Employees initiate a booking request by clicking the Create button, filling in the required event details, and submitting the form for approval. The request is then reviewed and approved by authorized personnel within Acharya.

All submitted bookings can be viewed in a table format, where employees can track the status (e.g., approved/pending), as well as other key information such as event date, time, venue, and more.
