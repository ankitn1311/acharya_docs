# ⚙️ Service Render

## 📋 Overview

(to be discused)
    

In this section under My Menu, employees can view all the service requests (indents) they have raised, along with the current status of each request. This includes both ongoing and previously completed services such as HR support, maintenance, IT support, and other internal service categories available within Acharya.

The page is divided into two tabs: Render and History.

*   The Render tab displays all currently active or ongoing service requests that the employee has submitted. These are requests that are still in process or awaiting completion by the respective department.  
      
      
    
*   The History tab provides a complete list of all previously completed or closed service requests. Employees can refer to this tab to track past service interactions and check the details or outcomes of those requests.  
      
    

This structured view allows employees to manage and monitor their service requests efficiently and maintain a record of all actions taken.
