# Deductions Management Module

This section contains two dedicated tabs—**TDS** and **Advance**—used to manage and track deductions made from employees' monthly compensation. These deductions directly impact the **Net Pay** shown in the monthly salary reports.

## Tabs Overview:

### 1. **TDS (Tax Deducted at Source)**

- Allows authorized users to **add TDS entries** for individual employees.
- The specified TDS amount is **automatically deducted** from the employee’s gross salary each month.
- This ensures accurate tax reporting and compliance with statutory regulations.

### 2. **Advance**

- Enables entry of **advance payments** made to employees.
- Two options are available under this tab:
  - **Advance** – General monetary advances given to the employee.
  - **LIC** – Deductions made towards LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) payments on behalf of the employee.
- These amounts are reflected in the **Monthly Salary Report** under respective deduction columns.

## Functionality:

- Both **TDS** and **Advance** deductions contribute to calculating the employee’s **Net Pay** each month.
- Only users with appropriate access rights can add or modify these deductions.
- Ensures centralized and consistent management of financial deductions across payroll cycles.

## Integration with Salary Report:

- All entries made in the **TDS** and **Advance** tabs are seamlessly integrated into the **Salary Sheet**, ensuring:
  - Accurate deduction records
  - Transparent net pay calculations
  - Reliable payroll processing
