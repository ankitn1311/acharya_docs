# Staff NOC

Under the **Approver** tab, employees with approval authority can view and manage Staff NOC (No Objection Certificate) requests submitted by other employees. This functionality allows approvers to review all relevant details and take appropriate actions on submitted requests.

All request data is displayed in a **structured table format** within the New Staff Approver section.
