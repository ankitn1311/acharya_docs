The above diagram illustrates the core relationships and flow within the Hostel Master module:

- **Hostel Block** is the top-level entity, representing a physical building or section. Each block can be managed by a Doctor or Warden.
- **Hostel Room** entities are created within a block and represent individual rooms. Each room is linked to a specific block.
- **Hostel Bed** entities are associated with rooms, allowing for detailed tracking of bed-level occupancy and assignments.
- **Features** such as Search & Filter, Export, and Status Management are available across all entities, enabling efficient data handling and administrative control.
