# 📊 Marks Report

## 🔐 Marks Report Access

In the Marks Report section, only an authorized employee can view student scores for internal assessments.

### 🎯 Program‑Specific Filtering

The employee first selects the relevant Program (and, if needed, the corresponding Academic Year or Institute) to narrow down the results.

### 📝 Comprehensive Internal Marks

Once the program is chosen, the report displays each student's internal exam marks in a clear, consolidated view.

### 📋 Organized Grid Layout

All marks appear in a structured grid, making it easy to scan, compare, and verify scores without navigating away.
