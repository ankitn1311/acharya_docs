# 🔒 CIE Marks Finalization & Locking

## 🔐 CIE Marks Finalization & Locking

In the CIE Marks Entry interface, once all scores for a student have been entered and reviewed, an authorized employee can finalize and lock those marks to prevent further edits.

## 🔒 Locking Procedure

To lock a student's marks, simply select the row corresponding to that student in the grid. A Lock button (or padlock icon) will become active.

## ✅ Confirmation Step

After clicking Lock, the system will prompt for confirmation ("Are you sure you want to finalize and lock these marks?"). This helps avoid accidental locking.

## 📖 Read‑Only State

Once locked, the student's marks turn read‑only: fields are disabled, and the row is visually marked (for example, with a padlock symbol or shaded background).

## 🔓 Unlocking (if needed)

If a correction is required after locking, an administrator can unlock the marks by selecting the row again and choosing Unlock—but only users with higher privileges have this option.

## 📋 Audit Trail

Each lock/unlock action is recorded in the system's audit log, showing who performed the action and when, ensuring full transparency and accountability.
