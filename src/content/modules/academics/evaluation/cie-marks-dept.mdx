## 🔐 Marks Report Access

In the Marks Report section, only an authorized employee can view student scores for internal assessments.

### 🎯 Program‑ and Institute‑Specific Filtering

Before loading the report, the employee selects the relevant Program and can also choose a specific Institute (and Academic Year if needed) to narrow down whose marks to display.

### 📝 Comprehensive Internal Marks

Once the filters are applied, the report presents each student's internal exam marks in a clear, consolidated view.

### 📋 Organized Grid Layout

All marks appear in a structured grid, making it easy to scan, compare, and verify scores without navigating away.
