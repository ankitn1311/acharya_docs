# 📅 Timetable User Section

## 🎯 Overview

The Timetable User section provides authorized employees with the ability to create and manage timetables for program courses. This functionality is largely the same as that provided in the [Timetable Creation](/modules/academics/acadmic-master/tt-creation) section, with one key distinction regarding access privileges.

## 🔐 Access Control

### 👥 Authorized Employees:
Employees with appropriate permissions can access this section to create and manage timetables. However, their access is restricted to their own institute or school. They cannot view or edit timetables for other institutes.

### 👑 Super Admin:
The Super Admin holds comprehensive access rights, including:

- Timetable Creation across all institutes/schools.
- Timetable User access for all users and institutes.

## ⚙️ Functional Capabilities

Authorized users can perform the following tasks:

- Create new timetables for courses under their institute/school.
- Edit existing timetables as necessary.
- View the timetable assignments for reference or update.

## 🚫 Limitations

- Cross-institute timetable creation is not permitted for regular employees.
- Only the Super Admin and specifically authorized users have the capability to manage timetables across multiple institutes or schools.
