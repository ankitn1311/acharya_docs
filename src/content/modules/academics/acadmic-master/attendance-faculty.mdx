## 🧑‍🏫 Attendance Faculty

### 📄 Overview  
The **Attendance Faculty** section allows employees to view student attendance reports based on faculty members and their assigned subjects. This section provides visibility into how students are attending specific subjects under each faculty.

### 📊 Report Views  
The attendance report can be viewed in two formats:
- **Detailed Report**: Displays individual attendance records per session for each student enrolled in the subject.
- **Cumulative Report**: Summarizes the overall attendance of each student in the subject, showing the total number of presents, absents, and attendance percentage.

This feature supports academic tracking by associating attendance directly with the responsible faculty and subject.
