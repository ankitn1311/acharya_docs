## 🏫 Attendance-Institute

### 📄 Overview  
The **Attendance-Institute** section provides the same functionality as the **Section Attendance Report**. It allows employees to view student attendance records in detail.

### 🔐 Access Restriction  
The key difference is that this section is **restricted to the employee’s own school or institute**. Employees can only view attendance data for students within their assigned institution.

This ensures controlled visibility and maintains data privacy across multiple institutions or schools within the system.
