## Architecture

The Academic Master follows a sophisticated hierarchical model that mirrors real-world educational institutions:

**Primary Structure:**

- **Institute** → **School** → **Department** → **Program** → **Specialization**
- **Program Assignments** linking programs to schools with academic year
- **Pattern Configurations** defining semester/yearly structures
- **Duration** with automatic calculation capabilities

Common features such as create, update, search, filter, export, and status management are available across all entities.
