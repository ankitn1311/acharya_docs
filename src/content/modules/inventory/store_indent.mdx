# Store Indent

The **Store Indent** section in Acharya ERP allows departments to formally request items or materials from the central store or inventory unit. Users can view all store indent requests, create new indents by selecting required items and quantities, and cancel indents that are no longer needed. This module streamlines internal requisition processes and ensures efficient inventory management.
