# Inventory Module

The **Inventory Module** in Acharya ERP provides a comprehensive platform for managing all aspects of institutional inventory, procurement, and stock movement. It streamlines the creation and management of stores, measurement units, vendors, and inventory items, and supports the entire workflow from requisition (indent) to purchase, receipt, and issue of goods.
