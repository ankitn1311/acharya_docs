The diagram above illustrates the structure of the Feedback Module:

- **Questionnaire** is linked to schools and forms the basis for feedback submissions.
- **Feedback Submission** connects students and faculty, and is only possible within an active **Feedback Window** (defined by academic year, program, and semester).
- **Percentage Freeze** is a setting that enforces the minimum required feedback submission percentage per school and academic year.
- This architecture ensures that feedback is collected in a controlled, configurable, and auditable manner, supporting institutional quality assurance.
