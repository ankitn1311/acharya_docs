## Architecture Diagram

This architecture diagram illustrates a secure, layered backend system for a modern web and mobile application.

The flow begins at the Client Layer (React web and mobile apps), passes through robust Security Filters (CORS, rate limiting, JWT authentication), and leverages dedicated Authentication Services for user management and token handling. The Controller and Service Layers manage REST API endpoints and business logic, while the Repository Layer handles data access with JPA repositories. All persistent data is stored in a MySQL Database, and external integrations like the WhatsApp Business API support features such as password resets and notifications. This modular design ensures scalability, maintainability, and strong security throughout the application stack.

- Validation of request origins against an approved domain list
- Prevention of unauthorized cross-origin requests
- Mitigation of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks
- Management of preflight requests for complex HTTP methods

**Implementation:** Spring Security CORS configuration

<Callout type="error">**Current State:** Allows access from any domain (`*`).</Callout>

<Callout>
  **Recommended:** Restrict access to `acharyerp.acharyaerptech.in` for enhanced security.
</Callout>

---

#### Rate Limiter (Bucket4j Implementation)

**Purpose:**  
Protects the system from abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service (DDoS) by enforcing granular rate limits.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Endpoint-specific and user-specific request limiting
- DDoS attack prevention and fair resource allocation
- Graceful degradation under high load

**Technology:** Bucket4j (in-memory)

<Callout type="error">
  **Current State:** 10,000 requests/minute (166/sec), no user/IP-specific limits. Vulnerable to
  abuse and DDoS.
</Callout>
