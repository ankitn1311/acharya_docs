### Immediate Mitigation

1. **Restrict Public Access:** Block `/api/UserAuthentication` endpoint.
2. **Invalidate Reset Tokens:** Expire all password reset tokens.
3. **Force Password Resets:** Require all users to change passwords.

> **Critical Alert:** Immediate action is required to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.

### Primary Attack Scenarios

- **🔐 Credential Harvesting**: Attackers can download all usernames, emails, and hashed passwords
- **⚡ Brute Force Attacks**: Even with bcrypt hashing, attackers can attempt to crack passwords offline
- **👤 Account Takeover**: Successful password cracking leads to unauthorized access
- **🔑 Password Reset Exploitation**: Exposed reset tokens can be used to hijack accounts
- **📊 Data Enumeration**: Attackers can map your entire user base, roles, and organizational structure

### Immediate Mitigation Strategy

### ⚠️ Emergency Actions (Do Now)

1. **Block Public Access**: Immediately restrict the `/api/UserAuthentication` endpoint
2. **Invalidate Reset Tokens**: Force expire all password reset tokens
3. **Force Password Resets**: Require all users to change passwords immediately
